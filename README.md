in this little project, i connected a arduino boared with 6 servo motors and 6 potentiometer to control each motor. 
i connnected positive wires and ground wires for all the pieces on a breadboard. 
then i connected the servo motors and the potentiometers to the arduino board to program them.
in the code i connected all the servo motors and the potentiometers to their respective ports.
and finally i made a loop that check the potentiometers positions, and move the servo motors accordingly.
